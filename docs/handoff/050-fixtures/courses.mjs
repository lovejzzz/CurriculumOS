// The Crucible fixed reference suite — faithful prompt reconstructions of the
// four V0.14 output-audit courses, six genome-covered courses (V0.14.3 WS-B1),
// and a rotating stranger pool (WS-B3).
//
// The original four are the regression bar: a refine-loop change is only an
// improvement if it improves THESE courses. The 'all' spec keeps meaning the
// original four so release rounds stay comparable; 'extended' is all ten
// genome+audit courses.
//
// Prompt wording note: each prompt opens with "a NN-lesson ... course" because
// src/lib/detectLessons.js treats the hyphenated "NN-lesson" form as a
// high-confidence match, which pins the lesson count deterministically and
// skips the extra lesson-detection AI call on landing continue.
//
// Genome courses (WS-B1): each lesson title is named after an actual shard
// concept term/alias (read from public/genome/<discipline>-intro.json) so the
// CurriculumOS linker resolves it. `expectGenome` is set ONLY where the shard
// covers the discipline AND the live linker actually links lessons (see the
// grader's genome-bar honesty check, deepQualityGrader checkHonesty). The
// original four carry expectGenome only where Round-4 PROVED linkage:
//   - cs-python: cs shard, Round-4 linked 13/15 lessons → expectGenome 'cs'.
//   - geology:   geo shard, Round-4 linked 13/14 lessons → expectGenome 'geo'.
//   - world-lit: lit shard exists but is thin (2 concepts: close reading,
//     literary argument); Round-4 linked 0/14 (lessons name authors/works, not
//     those concepts). NOT marked — marking it would fire a false genome-bar
//     P1 on regrade. Documented gap; revisit when the lit shard grows.
//   - mandarin:  no 'lang' shard → not eligible.
